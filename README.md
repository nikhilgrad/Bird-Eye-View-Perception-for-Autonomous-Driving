# Bird-Eye-View-Perception-for-Autonomous-Driving

In bird's eye view (BEV) perception, the goal is to transform the 3D world into a top-down representation that simplifies scene understanding for tasks such as autonomous driving and robotics. BEV representations are inherently 2D, offering a comprehensive view of the environment from above. However, cameras only capture images in perspective views, making the transition from camera data to BEV non-trivial and hard to perform. 

The 3D to 2D projection plays a critical role in bridging this gap. It involves mapping points from the 3D world or a simulated environment to the 2D plane of a camera image. By projecting 3D coordinates into the corresponding 2D camera views, this task aligns the real-world spatial data with the visual perspective captured by cameras. This alignment is essential for constructing accurate BEV representations, enabling machines to interpret the world effectively in both 3D and 2D contexts.
